# Integrated Project Repository C PUC CAMPINAS

This Project aims to implement a Client-Server application for solving maze problems.
To organize the development process of this project, it is being divided into 3 parts that we are calling PRODUCTS.

- ***PRODUCT 01 (P1)*** - *Maze Solver:* part of the program that aims to solve maze problems. The program has the ability to read text files that show the configuration of a maze and find its way to the exit of the maze.
- ***PRODUCT 02 (P2)*** - *Maze editor:* part of what is added to the version of P1, and aims to add a graphical interface to the program for creating maze. This editor allows the user to create / update their maze text (.txt) files and in real time the alert of the rules that are fulfilled for the creation of a maze.
- ***PRODUCT 03 (P3)*** - *Client-Server Application for Maze Storage and Sharing:* built a client-server application, in which the client is built from product 02 (P2), ie , the editor + maze solver program will become the customer. The server is implemented with the aim that multiple users (clients) can store their mazes on the server and can also share their mazes with other clients.
